Introduction
=================
This software package applies a metallicity calibration to low-resolution spectra of RR Lyrae variable stars.
The calibration is in the style of Layden 94, but with significant updates.

This software is for

#. Determining and updating a metallicity calibration
#. Applying a calibration

See paper [...] for details about how the calibration was made, and for further scientific information.
If you do use this calibration or software, please cite the paper `[Authors] (2020)`.
