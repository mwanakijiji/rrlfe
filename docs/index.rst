This software package can either 

#. Apply a metallicity calibration to low-resolution (R ~2000) RR Lyrae spectra spanning 3911 to 4950 angstroms
#. Generate a metallicity calibration anew, from real or synthetic spectra 

The calibration builds on that of `Layden 1994 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994AJ....108.1016L/abstract>`_. See paper `Spalding et al. 2023 <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/527/1/828/7326007>`_ for details about how the calibration was made, and for further scientific information.
Please cite the paper if you do use this calibration or software.
