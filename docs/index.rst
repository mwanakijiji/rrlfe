Documentation for rrlfe
=================================

This software package applies a metallicity calibration to low-resolution spectra of RR Lyrae variable stars.
The calibration is in the style of Layden 94, but with significant updates.

This software is for either

#. Determining and updating a metallicity calibration
#. Applying a calibration to low-resolution (R ~2000) spectroscopy

See paper `[TBD] <https://uknowledge.uky.edu/physastron_etds/22/>`_ for details about how the calibration was made, and for further scientific information.
If you do use this calibration or software, please cite the paper `[TBD] (2023)`.
